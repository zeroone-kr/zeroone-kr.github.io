Happy hacking!

No Pain, No Gain!

Hi! I am currently a master's student at UNIST S2Lab.

My research interests focus on finding vulnerabilities in both closed and open-source software. In particular, I am passionate about areas such as IoT device fuzzing, open-source fuzzing, and static analysis.

In 2023, I completed the BoB 11th course, where I learned about vulnerability analysis for the first time. I continue to work in this field.

In my free time, I enjoy boxing and weightlifting.

My motto is "No Pain, No Gain."

Happy hacking!
